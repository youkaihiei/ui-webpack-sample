Instructions:
* Pull the repo and run `npm install`
* For dev, run `npm run dev` - this will concatenate assets
* For productin run `npm run build` - this will concatenate and minify assets

All source files (js, images, css) are in the src folder. Results from build commands will be in a ./dist folder

Current set up supports sass and ES6/2015. Features in the future will compress images and purify the css and other cool stuff like that.
